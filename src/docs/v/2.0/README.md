# üçÅ Sugar Maple

![Latest Stable Version](https://poser.pugx.org/leafs/cli/v/stable)
![Total Downloads](https://poser.pugx.org/leafs/cli/downloads)

Leaf CLI v2 (Sugar Maple) builds on the functionality provided by the earlier version. It comes with faster load times, full scaffolds, bug fixes and a ton of other powerful functionality. You can now work with presets, scaffold projects using both v2 and v3 of leaf.

Unlike v1, v2 supports all leaf scaffolds: leaf, leaf mvc, leaf api and skeleton. It also uses in-built scaffolds instead of zip files packaged on leaf downloads coupled with composer downloads which make Leaf CLI 2 faster and even more reliable.

## Upgrading

You can upgrade from v1 by simply running the [installation script](/docs/#installation).

Version 2 of Leaf CLI has auto upgrades which means that it will keep itself up to date.

## Creating a leaf app

To start a new project, simply open up your console or terminal and move into the directory you want to generate your project. From there, you can use the `create` command:

```bash
leaf create <project-name>
```

with leaf 3:

```sh
leaf create <project-name> --v3
```

or with leaf 2:

```sh
leaf create <project-name> --v2
```

This will now prompt you to select a preset <Badge text="New in v2" />

```sh
Creating a new Leaf app "<project-name>" in ./projects-directory.

* Please pick a preset 
  [0] leaf
  [1] leaf mvc
  [2] leaf api
  [3] skeleton
 > 
```

::: tip
Note that you are to select a number, not type the name of the preset.
:::

Selecting a number will generate a leaf app based on the associated preset. As you can see, there are 4 presets:

- **Leaf**: a bare leaf project
- **Leaf MVC**: a leaf MVC project with leaf 2
- **Leaf API**: a leaf API project with leaf 2
- **Skeleton**: a leaf skeleton project

After picking a preset, if no version was specified, leaf will display an interactive version picker like the one above:

```sh
* Select a version to use 
  [0] v3
  [1] v2
 >
```

your project will be automatically generated and initialized. All you need to do is open it up and start coding üöÄ

### Quick presets

Leaf CLI also provides a quicker way to initialize your project without having to go through the interactive installer. You can use the `--mvc`, `--api`, `--basic` and `--skeleton` options to generate your project based on a specific presets. `--basic` generates a raw leaf project.

eg: `leaf create backend-api --api`

This will create a leaf api project named `backend-api`.

### Versioning

If no version is specified, leaf displays the interactive installer to you, however, to quickly install a particular version, you can use the `--v2` or `--v3` options. These can be coupled with presets as well.

Leaf API 3 example:

```sh
leaf create backend-api --api --v3
```

## Running your leaf apps

After generating your leaf app, you can `cd` into the directory and spin up a local dev server using leaf cli's `serve` command.

```sh
cd backend-api
leaf serve
```

You can also specify the port to run your leaf app on using the `--port` or `-p` options.

```sh
leaf serve -p 3000
```

## Installing packages

This cli tool also adds a feature to install leaf packages from composer.

```bash
leaf install leafs/ui
```

If you are installing a leaf module or package, you can leave out the `leafs/` part.

```sh
leaf install ui
```

You can also pass in a bunch of packages to install at once.

```sh
leaf install ui db illuminate/support
```

***Versioning <Badge text="new in 2.0.5" />***

Leaf CLI also allows you to install a particular version of any package using `@`

```sh
leaf install ui@1.0 illuminate/support@9.0.2
```

***Package Chaining <Badge text="new in 2.0.5" />***

You can now add a bunch of packages to install as done with composer, npm and other CLIs as well.

```sh
leaf install db illuminate/support
```

Using this method, you can even add specific versions of some packages like this:

```sh
leaf install db illuminate/support@9.0.2 nesbot/carbon
```

## Interactive Shell

You can also use the interactive shell to interact with your app.

```bash
$ leaf interact
...
>>> $user = new User;
...
>>> $user->name = "Mychi";
...
>>> $user->save();
```

## Updating leaf cli

v2 contains an easy way to quickly update leaf cli to the latest version.

```bash
leaf update
```
